Installation:
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



(First time only) Download NLTK resources
The app will attempt to download required NLTK data automatically. If you see errors, run:
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt')



Prepare data files:

Make sure mood_keywords.json is present in the project directory.
The app will create journal_entries.csv automatically when you save your first entry.


Usage:
Start the app:
streamlit run app.py


Open your browser:
Visit the local URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

Notes:

Standard library modules (os, re, uuid, etc.) are used and do not require installation.
All data is stored locally in CSV and JSON files.
For best results, ensure your mood_keywords.json contains at least 10 moods and 200+ keywords.
